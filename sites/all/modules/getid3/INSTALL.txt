INSTALL
-------
1. Place the entire getid3 directory into your modules directory
   (sites/all/modules is the usual location).
2. Create a new folder for the getID3 library at:
     cd YOUR-DRUPAL-ROOT
     mkdir -p sites/all/libraries/getid3
3. Go to http://www.getid3.org/ and download the latest stable version
   (currently 1.8.2) into the new directory:
     cd sites/all/libraries/getid3
     wget "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/getid3/getID3%28%29%201.x/1.8.2/getid3-1.8.2-20101206.zip"
4. Unzip the contents of the zip file into sites/all/libraries/getid3/ so that
   write.php is located in sites/all/libraries/getid3/getid3/:
     unzip getid3-1.8.2.zip
5. Delete the demos directory:
     rm -r demos/
6. Go to Dashboard > Modules and enable the GetID3 module.
7. Go to Dashboard > Configuration > Media > getID3. If you see the version you
   just downloaded, the module is installed correctly.
