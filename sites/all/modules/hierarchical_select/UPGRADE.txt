# Upgrading (from Drupal 6 to 7)

1. **BE WARE THAT NOT ALL FUNCTIONALITY HAS BEEN PORTED!**

	Make sure that you know if the part of Hierarchical Select's functionality
	that you want to use has been ported. Otherwise, you may be in for a
	frustrating upgrade experience.

	See the included TODO.txt file for details. In a nutshell:

	- Taxonomy support is almost complete, only "create new item", "entity count" and token support are missing
	- Forum support has **not** yet been ported (but relies on Taxonomy, so this is trivial)
	- Taxonomy Views support has **not** yet been ported
	- Menu support has **not** yet been ported

2. Upgrade this module just like any other: delete the old module, copy the
	files of the new module and run update.php.  
	For details, see <http://drupal.org/node/570162>.

3. That's it! :)
