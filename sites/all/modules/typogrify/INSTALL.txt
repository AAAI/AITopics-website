To install Typogrify, move the entire "typogrify" directory into your Drupal
installation's modules folder.


Enable the module:

Administer -> Site building -> Modules


Add it as an input format:

Go to Administer -> Site configuration -> Input Formats and then click
configure next to the format you'd like to add it to.

For starters, you probably just want to add this filter to your default input
format. Typogrify expects html input so it should be be the last filter you
apply (ie, after Markdown). Typogrify will not work as expected if it is
applied to plain text, or if it is the only filter applied to the text. 


Choose which typographic refinements to apply:

Administer -> Site configuration -> Input Formats -> [Your Input Format] -> Configure
