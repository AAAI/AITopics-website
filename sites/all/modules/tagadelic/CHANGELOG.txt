        [tagadelic] 7.x-1.0, 14-12-2009
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Removed theme_tagadelic_more and replaced that with the general theme_more_link.
        Refer to the documentation on theme_more_link for its usage: http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_more_link/7
        TODO: People with a theme that overrides theme_tagadelic_more, should remove
              that part from their theme and replace it with theme_more_link. 
              
        tagadelic_build_weighted_tags() first argument now is an array of tags. 
        And no longer a Query result. Reason for change is better use of the new 
        database layer in Drupal.
        TODO: People who use the function tagadelic_build_weighted_tags() should change
              their code so that it has a list of tags (array) and pass that trough the
              tagadelic_build_weighted_tags() builder.
              
        removed $node->tags on node_load.
        This addition was used by a block, but caused trouble and (quite some) overhead.
        TODO: Themes, modules and content that relied on $node->tags should rewrite 
              their code to use $node->taxonomy from (core) taxonomy module!
              
        removed "tags for current node" block. 
        This block was not a cloud and therefore does not belong to the functions of this
        module. It should be implemented with either views, or an extremely simple module.
        TODO: if you relied on the "tags in current node" block, re-implement that with a 
              simple module (suggestions and/or links and/or references to such a module 
              are welcome). Or re-implement it with a view (links to a manual and/or howtos
              are welcome).
