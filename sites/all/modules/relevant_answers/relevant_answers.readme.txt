Relevant Answers enables users to raise questions and get answers about specific pages on a site. Questions and answers are tracked by the drupal path for a page.

It is based on the "Answers" module. See http://drupal.org/projects/answers . It is also compatible with 

Summary of Functionality
 - Users can raise new questions about a page.
 - Users can review the questions already raised about a page. They can also review answers already provided for each question and/or add their own answers.
 - Users have the functionality for questions already provided by Answers (e.g., asking to be notified when someone provides an answer, setting permissions for who can ask questions)

Site administrators can decide which of the Relevant Answers blocks are displayed and which pages provide them (using the standard blocks administration functions ('admin/build/block')).
